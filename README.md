# hello-world
This is where my Coding Journey begins.

Hello everyone.
I have zero coding, zero programming, and zero web development knowledge. But today is the day where I change all of that. Today is the day I go from Zero to Hero. :) I am here to learn. And hopefully one day, when I've become a seasoned coder, I can teach those who are in the position I am in now.
